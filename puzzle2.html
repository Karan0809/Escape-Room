                    "Thank you for rescueing me from my prison, now let's get out of here." The door opened and Trent walked out.
                    <br>
                    "Why were you in a prison cell?" Ryan asked.
                    <br>
                    "I don't know, I was just always in a prison cell I guess."
                    <br>
                    Trent started walking up to a pillar, he lead the way to a deeper part into the cave system. Ryan followed him.
                    <br>
                    "Where are we going?" Ryan asked.
                    <br>
                    "Wherever this leads us." Trent answered.
                    A while later, they ended up at a dead end, but there was a small stone pillar and Trent had noticed it.
                    <br>
                    "What's that?" Ryan said, he pointed up to the wall next to the pillar. It had writing on it.
